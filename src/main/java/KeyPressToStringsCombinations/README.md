KeyPad Hack

User pressed numbers on keypad. What all possible combinations of words can be generated by keyPad
Ex. 2 translates to 'abc', 3 to 'def' and so on.
So, for 23 you have combination as 'ad', ae', 'af', 'bd'

There is no constraint on number of keys being pressed. Ex. 23 has 2 keys, 33324 has 5 keys and so on

How to Solve
-------------------
Treat each key Press as level.
For Each Level you have to iterate through all the numbers of next level
    Example: For 2-Level Key Press, 4(abc) 5(pqr)
             For level-1 'a' , you need to iterate through all the values of next level, i.e
                         ap, aq, ar

Once Current level is done. Move to next level and again iterate through all items in next level + 1

Put this in a recursive loop and it will give the desired result.


Coding
---------------------

 public static void recursed(int levelCounter[], int levelMax[], int level) {
        if ( level >= levelCounter.length) {
            return;     //The EXIT condition out of recursion
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < levelMax[level]; i++) {
            printLevel(levelCounter);
            recursed(levelCounter, levelMax, level  + 1);     //Go to one level up

            levelCounter[level]++;                            //This level is done..so increment its counter. For 'abc', it will take you from 'a' to 'b'
            resetLevels(levelCounter, level+1);               //Next level needs equal changce to iterate again from 0. So reset it to 0th index
        }

    }

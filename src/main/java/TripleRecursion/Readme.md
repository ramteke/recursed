Child Running staris in multiple Hops (1 step OR 2 step OR 3 step).

<br>How many possible ways child can run up the stairs ?

<br><br>Solution: (Similar to Factorials)<br>
<b>countSteps ( n - 1 ) * countSteps ( n - 2 ) * countSteps ( n -3 )</b>

<br>Note: You can take N as input and put countSteps() in for loop (when 3 is not fixed for max. number of hops)

<br>
Example: Given 10 steps, how many ways can a kid run up the stairs if he/she can climb 1 stair at a time OR 2 stairs OR 3 stairs at a time.

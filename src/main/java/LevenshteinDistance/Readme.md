Levenshtein distance (LD) is a measure of the similarity between two strings, which we will refer to as the source string (s) and the target string (t).

The distance is the number of deletions, insertions, or substitutions required to transform s into t.

The greater the Levenshtein distance, the more different the strings are.

The Levenshtein distance algorithm has been used in: Spell checking, Speech recognition, DNA analysis, Plagiarism detection

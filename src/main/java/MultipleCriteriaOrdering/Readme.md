<h1>Multiple Criteria Ordering</h1><br>

Get Max. Possible ordering (ex. by height) of objects by stacking them together.
<br><br>

Example: Order Boxes (Height/Weight/Depth) based on increasing height such that each box has lower weight and depth<br>
Example: Order People on increasing height such that weight is lower for each next person in line.<br>

<br>
Calculate height with a new Entity (Box/People) and one without addition of new Entity<br>
Keep track of calcution of height (or any other primary parameter) in a 2D array<br>
If you find calculation in 2D array then do not re-calculate.


<br><br>
Given Solution deals with ordering of Boxes such that height is primary metric and Weight and Depth is secondry.
Each box on top should have lower weight and depth.

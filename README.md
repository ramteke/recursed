Interesting recusrsion problems !!

1. KeyPad Hack<br>
		User pressed numbers on keypad. What all possible combinations of words can be generated by keyPad<br>
		Ex. 2 translates to 'abc',  3 to 'def' and so on.<br>
		So, for 23 you have combination as 'ad', ae', 'af', 'bd', ....<br><br>
		There is no constraint on number of keys being pressed. Ex. 23 has 2 keys, 33324 has 5 keys and so on

2. Is Path present in matrix<br>
		Given a 2D array, get Starting Indexes of all paths that match a give string.
		Valid paths are horizontal, vertical and diagonal (left -> right)

3. Longest sequence of Consecutive characters in a 2D matrix<br>
